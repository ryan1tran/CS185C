The HMM code has gotten a lot messier than was last seen during the midterm. It may or may not be readable.

The clustering Java code extracts features such as file size and entropy from the samples.
The clusterying Python code runs Random Forest and KNN.
Count Frequencies Python code did all the other preprocessing.

Enjoy our nicely formatted report. =)
